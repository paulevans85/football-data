# football-data

This is a Tableau web data connector html page, which turns json API endpoints into data source tables

The source site is called [football-data.org](http://football-data.org/index).
I recommend checking out all the data they have available, as it's pretty extensive

The files could be separated out better, but it's not terribly necessary
